**Time Required**: 1-2 hours
**Impact**: Critical for AdSense approval

## ‚≠ê MOST IMPORTANT: Check Google Indexing (30 minutes)

This is likely the #1 reason your application was rejected.

### Step 1: Check if Privacy and Terms pages are indexed (5 minutes)

Open Google.com and search for these EXACT queries:

```
site:autobusinessos.com/privacy/
```
‚úÖ **Expected**: You should see the Privacy Policy page in results
‚ùå **If no results**: This is a CRITICAL PROBLEM - Privacy page is NOT indexed

```
site:autobusinessos.com/terms/
```
‚úÖ **Expected**: You should see the Terms of Service page in results
‚ùå **If no results**: This is a CRITICAL PROBLEM - Terms page is NOT indexed

**AdSense CANNOT approve your application if these pages are not indexed!**

---

### Step 2: Check total indexed pages (5 minutes)

```
site:autobusinessos.com
```

‚úÖ **Expected**: Should show 20-30+ pages
‚ö†Ô∏è **If 10-20 pages**: Needs improvement
‚ùå **If less than 10**: CRITICAL PROBLEM

---

### Step 3: Request indexing in Google Search Console (20 minutes)

If any pages are NOT indexed, do this immediately:

1. **Go to Google Search Console**
   - URL: https://search.google.com/search-console
   - Select property: autobusinessos.com

2. **Use URL Inspection Tool for these pages** (in order):

   **Priority 1 - REQUIRED for AdSense:**
   ```
   [ ] https://www.autobusinessos.com/privacy/
   [ ] https://www.autobusinessos.com/terms/
   [ ] https://www.autobusinessos.com/contact/
   [ ] https://www.autobusinessos.com/about/
   ```

   **Priority 2 - Important:**
   ```
   [ ] https://www.autobusinessos.com/ (homepage)
   [ ] https://www.autobusinessos.com/solutions/
   [ ] https://www.autobusinessos.com/resources/blog/
   ```

   **Priority 3 - All blog posts:**
   ```
   [ ] All 10 blog post URLs (list below)
   ```

3. **For each URL:**
   - Enter URL in inspection tool
   - Click "Request Indexing"
   - Wait for confirmation
   - Move to next URL

4. **Submit sitemap:**
   - In GSC, go to "Sitemaps"
   - Enter: `sitemap.xml`
   - Click "Submit"

**‚ö†Ô∏è Important**: Google needs 3-7 days to index pages. Do NOT reapply to AdSense until indexing is complete!
