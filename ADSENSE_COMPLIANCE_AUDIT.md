**Location**: Homepage - Multiple sections

**Problematic Claims**:
1. "reducing manual tasks by up to 60%"
2. "40-60% reduction in manual work hours"
3. "3-5x faster task completion"
4. "80%+ fewer errors"
5. "Start at 89% accuracy, improve to 97%+ within three months"

- **No case studies** referenced
- Could be considered **false advertising** if not provable
- AdSense prohibits "deceptive or misleading content"

**Risk Level**: üî¥ **HIGH** - Could lead to AdSense rejection or account suspension

---

### Issue #2: False/Unprovable Certifications ‚ö†Ô∏è CRITICAL

**Location**: Homepage - Security section

**Problematic Claim**:
```
"ISO27001 and SOC2 certified"
```

**Why This Violates AdSense Policy**:
- **Extremely serious** if not true
- ISO27001 and SOC2 are **verifiable certifications**
- Claiming certifications you don't have is **fraud**
- AdSense will likely **immediately reject** the application

**Risk Level**: üî¥ **CRITICAL** - Must verify or remove immediately

**Action Required**:

**Why This Could Violate AdSense Policy**:

**Risk Level**: üü° **MEDIUM** - Could be flagged during review

---

2. "Your marketing manager can create email sequences, your operations lead can automate approvals"

**Why This Could Be Problematic**:
- Implies **anyone** can use it without training
