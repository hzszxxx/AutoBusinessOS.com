**Example Opening**:
```
Are your teams spending 40% of their time on repetitive tasks?
You're not alone. Our 2024 survey of 500 operations managers
found that manual processes are still the #1 productivity killer.

Here's the good news: automation can eliminate up to 80% of
this work—and you can start today.
```

Feature: Smart Workflow Builder

Just drag, drop, and deploy. Your first automation can
go live before lunch."
```

Challenge: How Acme Corp Eliminated 50 Hours of Manual Work Per Week

When Sarah Chen joined as COO, her team was drowning in
spreadsheets. Three full-time employees spent their days
copying data between systems. It was expensive, error-prone,
and unsustainable.

Three months later, those employees had moved to strategic
roles—and the company was processing 3x more orders with
the same headcount.
```

### 5. Legal Pages (Privacy, Terms)
**Tone**: Clear, formal, straightforward
**Length**: As needed
**Focus**: Plain language wherever possible

**Example**:
```

for operations managers at mid-size companies. The tone should
be professional but conversational. Include: problem statement,
3 main solutions, 1 case study, and actionable next steps.
```

**For Tone Refinement**:
```
Rewrite this paragraph to sound more like a confident industry
expert giving practical advice, less like a marketing brochure.
Use active voice and specific examples.
